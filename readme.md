# Cramer's Rule + Inverse matrix calculation using adjugate matrices

## Setup
The programs compile successfully using the https://www.onlinegdb.com environment.  
To run programs in https://www.onlinegdb.com, you need to copy the main script file (`cramers.py` or `inverse_adjugate.py`), and the functions from `common.py` file. (Don't forget to remove the import!)  
`numpy` library needs to be installed to run the programs locally.  

## Files
`common.py` - file with common functions like calculating determinant and getting input from the user.
`cramers.py` - solve system of linear algebraic equations in matrix form using Cramer's rule.
`inverse_adjugate.py` - calculate inverse of a matrix using adjugate matrices.

## License
The code is free to distribute and to be used anywhere.
